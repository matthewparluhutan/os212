# Top 10 List for Week 1

1. [Vi] (https://www.cs.colostate.edu/helpdocs/vi.html) <br>
Talking about vi, vi is pretty important especially when you are faced with a problem regarding things like your .bash_profile. You might want to learn more about vi. Even more reason to learn vi is because it's currently the default editor for UNIX Operating System. If you are interested in learning more, this site is the one for you
2. [Nano] (https://www.nano-editor.org/dist/latest/nano.html) <br>
For some of you who doesn't like complicated stuffs, here is another one for you. Nano is another editor used like Vi. Some people do actually like nano better than vi, this is because nano provides guide icons. But overall it IS worth it to learn to utilise two editors at once, you might need it in the future ;)
3. [Bash] (https://repl.it/languages/bash) <br>
Bash is a very useful thing to learn. It is used on many ocassions during OS. One website which is good for learning bash is repl.it, you should check it out :D
4. [Shell] (https://docs.cs.cf.ac.uk/notes/linux-shell-commands/) <br>
If you are interested in learning shell for whatever purpose, here is something that might interest you. This documentation is compressed so that only important things are written there. Honestly it's almost like a cheatsheet for shell, perfect for those who have the will but not the energy to learn.
5. [Shell Training] (https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/shell) <br>
Aside from the annoyance some people might feel towards hackerrank, it is actually a pretty good website to learn Linux shell. The tutorials might help you in learning more or practicing using shell. I recommend it for those willing to spend some times training their shell skill
