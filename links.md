# Top 10 List for Week 1

1. [Vi](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/helpdocs/vi.html) <br>
Talking about vi, vi is pretty important especially when you are faced with a problem regarding things like your .bash_profile. You might want to learn more about vi. Even more reason to learn vi is because it's currently the default editor for UNIX Operating System. If you are interested in learning more, this site is the one for you
2. [Nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/dist/latest/nano.html) <br>
For some of you who doesn't like complicated stuffs, here is another one for you. Nano is another editor used like Vi. Some people do actually like nano better than vi, this is because nano provides guide icons. But overall it IS worth it to learn to utilise two editors at once, you might need it in the future ;)
3. [Why use VIM?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM7UP-un1vc&ab_channel=LinuxTrainingAcademy) <br>
If you ever wonder, what's the fun in using VIM and why should you use VIM when you already have other editors such as nano, this video will make you rethink your decisions. Well, one of the reason is because VIM is ubiquitous meaning, the editor is by default existing in every linux systems, unlike nano or other editors that may or may not be there. There are many other several reasons and you should watch it yourself by clicking the link above :D 
4. [AWK](https://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Awk.html) <br>
This website is pretty useful when it comes to learning more about AWK. AWK is useful for scripting in many cases, for example, for scripting on websites. I first learnt of AWK from when there were two questions on scele. AWK piqued my interests, thus i searched for websites that have a full documentation on AWK. this one is one of them
5. [Bash](https://repl.it/languages/bash) <br>
Bash is a very useful thing to learn. It is used on many occasions during OS. One website which is good for learning bash is repl.it, you should check it out :D
6. [Shell](https://docs.cs.cf.ac.uk/notes/linux-shell-commands/) <br>
If you are interested in learning shell for whatever purpose, here is something that might interest you. This documentation is compressed so that only important things are written there. Honestly it's almost like a cheatsheet for shell, perfect for those who have the will but not the energy to learn.
7. [Regex](https://www.guru99.com/linux-regular-expressions.html) <br>
Moving on to regular expressions. What exactly is it? how is it relevant? Well, regular expression is something that is used simply as a guideline in writing something. So you need it in pretty much many occasions. Even in linux, we also use it, so it's a good idea to learn regex.
8. [Linux Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvA_wgsX6eFAOXI8Rbg_WiQ) <br>
The youtube channel "TutoriaLinux" teaches stuffs about the Linux Operating System, including shell, bash, and other things. The contents of the channel is not limited to the Operating System either, they went out of the way to give insights about job interviews or tech careers as well. This one is a worthy channel to watch if you have times.
9. [Mental Outlaw Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/MentalOutlawStudios) <br>
Mental Outlaw is a youtube channel that mainly focuses on Linux. The contents are covering beginner materials subjects regarding Linux distribution reviews and tutorials. I found out about his channel from my friend and after reviewing his contents, i think his channel is one of the top sources for learning.
10. [Windows VS Linux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZNFLhCkHrY&ab_channel=edureka%21) <br>
This one. This is it, this is for you guys that are wandering what the differences are between windows and linux. The video explains a lot about the histories of both Operating Systems, the differences, specifications, and which is better to use statistically speaking. It's quite good for quenching your thirst of knowledge or curiousity.

These are all the top 10 links from me, Qatlho' Qapla' je!
