# Top links (Week 1)

1. [Vi](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/helpdocs/vi.html) <br>
Talking about vi, vi is pretty important especially when you are faced with a problem regarding things like your .bash_profile. You might want to learn more about vi. Even more reason to learn vi is because it's currently the default editor for UNIX Operating System. If you are interested in learning more, this site is the one for you
2. [Nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/dist/latest/nano.html) <br>
For some of you who doesn't like complicated stuffs, here is another one for you. Nano is another editor used like Vi. Some people do actually like nano better than vi, this is because nano provides guide icons. But overall it IS worth it to learn to utilise two editors at once, you might need it in the future ;)
3. [Why use VIM?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM7UP-un1vc&ab_channel=LinuxTrainingAcademy) <br>
If you ever wonder, what's the fun in using VIM and why should you use VIM when you already have other editors such as nano, this video will make you rethink your decisions. Well, one of the reason is because VIM is ubiquitous meaning, the editor is by default existing in every linux systems, unlike nano or other editors that may or may not be there. There are many other several reasons and you should watch it yourself by clicking the link above :D 
4. [AWK](https://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Awk.html) <br>
This website is pretty useful when it comes to learning more about AWK. AWK is useful for scripting in many cases, for example, for scripting on websites. I first learnt of AWK from when there were two questions on scele. AWK piqued my interests, thus i searched for websites that have a full documentation on AWK. this one is one of them
5. [Bash](https://repl.it/languages/bash) <br>
Bash is a very useful thing to learn. It is used on many occasions during OS. One website which is good for learning bash is repl.it, you should check it out :D
6. [Shell](https://docs.cs.cf.ac.uk/notes/linux-shell-commands/) <br>
If you are interested in learning shell for whatever purpose, here is something that might interest you. This documentation is compressed so that only important things are written there. Honestly it's almost like a cheatsheet for shell, perfect for those who have the will but not the energy to learn.
7. [Regex](https://www.guru99.com/linux-regular-expressions.html) <br>
Moving on to regular expressions. What exactly is it? how is it relevant? Well, regular expression is something that is used simply as a guideline in writing something. So you need it in pretty much many occasions. Even in linux, we also use it, so it's a good idea to learn regex.
8. [Linux Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvA_wgsX6eFAOXI8Rbg_WiQ) <br>
The youtube channel "TutoriaLinux" teaches stuffs about the Linux Operating System, including shell, bash, and other things. The contents of the channel is not limited to the Operating System either, they went out of the way to give insights about job interviews or tech careers as well. This one is a worthy channel to watch if you have times.
9. [Mental Outlaw Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/MentalOutlawStudios) <br>
Mental Outlaw is a youtube channel that mainly focuses on Linux. The contents are covering beginner materials subjects regarding Linux distribution reviews and tutorials. I found out about his channel from my friend and after reviewing his contents, i think his channel is one of the top sources for learning.
10. [Windows VS Linux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZNFLhCkHrY&ab_channel=edureka%21) <br>
This one. This is it, this is for you guys that are wandering what the differences are between windows and linux. The video explains a lot about the histories of both Operating Systems, the differences, specifications, and which is better to use statistically speaking. It's quite good for quenching your thirst of knowledge or curiousity.

These are all the top links from me, Qatlho' Qapla' je!

# Top links (Week 2)

1. [Why Linux Security is Better Than Windows](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3252823/why-linux-is-better-than-windows-or-macos-for-security.html) <br>
Ever wonder which Operating System has got a better security? In this link you will learn about why Linux's security is far better than that of windows and macos.
2. [Top 9 Vulnerabilities](https://www.compuquip.com/blog/cybersecurity-threats-vulnerabilities) <br>
This site lists 9 common vulnerabilities that pose threats on our cybersecurity.By knowing possible threats on Operating Systems, we can enhance our Operating System to strengthen the Operating System's capability. 
3. [C-Language](https://www.learn-c.org/) <br>
I tried to learn some C language today. This website is a good start for that. I practiced C-language's syntax, etc. In this website, you will be guided on how to write a simple C program such as "hello world". And if you are a curious guy like me, there are even advanced C in this website. The website also teaches us the details regarding what a program does, and i recommend this website for you i you are interested in learning some basic C
4. [How Do Public and Private Key Work?](https://www.preveil.com/blog/public-and-private-key/) <br>
This website writes about private and public key and how they work. This is basically how they work : 
Bob wants to send Alice an encrypted email. To do this, Bob takes Aliceâ€™s public key and encrypts his message to her. Then, when Alice receives the message, she takes the private key that is known only to her in order to decrypt the message from Bob.
This website also explains a lot about other things regarding public and private key
5. [Malware and Viruses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PvxRmVg7uE&ab_channel=Gadgets360) <br>
Ever wonder how do malwares and viruses work. Well turns out it works by hijacking an official code and changes many things within. This youtube channel explains more about viruses and other malwares. It also talks about things like trojan horses etc. Why do we need to learn about malware? Well, it's to increase the Operating System's protection against them. As a wiseman once said, "To defeat your enemies, you must first become your enemy"
6. [RSA Encryption](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXB-V_Keiu8&ab_channel=ArtoftheProblem) <br>
This video explains about how RSA Encryption algorithm works. It uses many mathematical theories such as Euler, prime factorization, and modular exponentiation. It's interesting how those theories are actually applicable in this cryptography.
7. [PGP Tutorial](http://aperiodic.net/phil/pgp/tutorial.html) <br>
This can be used as a guide for learning more about key, encryption and how to use the PGP and GPG. I read some of the stuffs there, it mainly shows a guide for generating a key so far. Even though it doesn't seem much, the explanations are actually pretty specific and interesting.
8. [How SSH Works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORcvSkgdA58&ab_channel=Computerphile) <br>
What is SSH? SSH or Secure Shell connects from computers to computers remotely to connect those PCs. It also covers the problematic datas that are unprotected when connecting remotely so that our confidential datas are not breached. There are many more stuffs that are covered by this youtube video than this problem. I recommend watching this.
9. [Social Engineering](https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/security/social-engineering/#:~:text=Social%20engineering%20is%20a%20technique,whose%20data%20has%20been%20revealed.) <br>
How is social engineering related to this week's topic? Well, it's related to the cybersecurity of our Operating Systems. This site talks about how criminals would use social engineering to break into your system, and personally, i think knowing this might help us develop a much better Operating System security. 
10. [How Secure is 256 bit Security?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9JGmA5_unY&ab_channel=3Blue1Brown) <br>
How effective is SHA256 in hashing? well, 256 bit means 2^256 possible hashes. The current world population is about 7 billion lives. Taking that into account, 256 bit Security is supposed to be safe. Well, this link tells us the safety of 256 bit security. I recommend this link if you are interested in this topic :D

These are all the top links from me, Qatlho' Qapla' je, yay meH!!!


# Top links (Week 3)

1. [What is Mounting?](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19455-01/805-7228/6j6q7ueup/index.html)<br>
What is mounting? How do we do it? If you are interested, this link gives off the general idea of what mounting is. Well, generally speaking as a windows user, i didn't really know either since in windows, the practice is kind of different and we don't really mount stuffs. Linux however, needs to be mounted before a storage can be used. Mounting itself functions as an intermediate between the system root and the storage which allows the system to recognize the storage which we've just created. There are several other explanations that can be read in the link above.
2. [Mounting and Unmounting](https://www.computerhope.com/unix/umount.htm) <br>
Well, this one is related to the first link, kind of. Now after reading the article above, i'm expecting you to have already grasped the general idea of what mounting is and what it does. Now, i found the second part of learning more about mounting from the link above. It basically tells us more about mounting in linux. There are informations about the mounting syntax, how to do bind mount, and even specific mountings for filesystem. It is not a fun read if i'm honest with you, but it's far from being unworthy since by reading this article, you will learn a lot. And by a lot, i mean advance stuffs :D
3. [Linux File System](https://www.tecmint.com/linux-file-system-explained/) <br>
This link explains a lot about linux filesystems by definition. By reading the link above, i obtained lots of informations by reading this link. There are informations about the partition of the file system, about the booting with BIOS and UEFI, Types of linux file systems, etc. I recommend reading this one if you are interested in knowing more about file system.
4. [Which partition should we use?](https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/33552/htg-explains-which-linux-file-system-should-you-choose/) <br>
Still talking about linux file system, after knowing about what file system is, now we are going to talk about which partition to use. It explains a lot about the differences between each file systems, that file systems are more than just implementing read method, on dealing with fragmentations, etc. I recommend reading this too.
5. [System 32 Deletion???](https://www.howtogeek.com/346997/what-is-the-system32-directory-and-why-you-shouldnt-delete-it/#:~:text=While%20the%20System32%20folder%20isn,with%20your%20favorite%20antivirus%20program.) <br>
Don't do it, i beg you, stop it, stopppp. You didn't do it right? Phew, alright, i am going to tell you why you shouldn't delete your System 32 file. First of all, what exactly is system 32?? It is a file system which is used by windows which contains the Operating System of windows. What's more, inside system 32, there are many things like the SYS for example, that runs the Operating System. The rest are explained by the link above, but anyways, please don't ever delete your system 32, ever.
6. [C Language print](https://iq.opengenus.org/different-ways-to-print-in-c/) <br>
This one is not about systems, but rather about the c language. For those of you who don't know, most Operating Systems run on the C language which is why learning C is still aligned with this week's topic. Here is a short article about different types of printing when you are doing some scripting in C on your Operating System.
7. [Linux Directories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42iQKuQodW4&ab_channel=Fireship) <br>
Alright, back to this week's topic about file sistems. Now we have the linux directories. How does it work actually? I've been asking the question as well. I searched for it and i found this short video about how linux directory hierarchy works, and what it is. Check it out ;D !
8. [Reading & Writing Files in C? How?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQJBe4IbsvQ&ab_channel=JacobSorber) <br>
After coming this far, you should've read the first 7 links above (or watch the video if the link references to a video). You should've known so far about file systems and directories. I've also included some informations about the C language printing. Now combine the two and we're going onto the next topic, reading and writing files in C. Generally speaking there are two ways of doing this. By using open() or fopen(). Now what are the differences between the two? Well, in terms of type, actually the open() is much more primitive than fopen(), but less readable. There are many more differences and explanations on those if you watch the video from the link above. Qapla' SoH !!!
9. [File Descriptor? What is this??](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/19334/file-descriptor-fd) <br>
Now that you've learnt about reading and writing in C, we will move onto the next topic, File Descriptor. What is the correlation between this one and the previous topics? Well it is related to how a program is extracting an input and returning a really small positive integer. It helps identifying an open file within an Input/Output process and acts like some kind of index to identify the correct output of a program. You would also meet some things related to file descriptor in windows or any other programming related stuffs, for example stdin to receive an input. There are more explanations for file descriptor but i suggest your reading them yourselves to enrich your reading skills and knowledge :P
10. [File Compression? How does it work?](https://stephencharlesweiss.com/compression-tar-vs-zip-vs-rar-vs-gz/) <br>
Have you seen the .tar data type and then thought "hmm is this related to rar?" ? Well the short answer is no. I can explain it. Tar is actually the short for Tarball which is already introduced from the beginning of the course (see os.vlsm.org if you haven't). While it may look like tar is related to rar, it actually isn't. Tar datas are not compressed at all, unlike rar or zip. Tar datas are encrypted and extracting it would required a decryption. So in a sense, maybe they are kind of similar in how they are both processed as a single file and then extracted to obtain the files inside. The forms they both take however is different, as rar and zip actually compressed the files while tarball encrypts it and then producing a PGP key as a result. For more informations that are more accurate, you can try reading the article above. Goodluck !

If you are reading this, then you have completed your journey on my lists sir/madame. Congratulations ghoQ SoH. ghuH bIpIv'a', Qatlho' Qapla' je, yay meH !!!

# Top links (Week 4)

1. [Memory and Pointers](http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/102/)<br>
Ever been interested in memory and pointers in general? This website is for you then. It explains a lot about pointers in C language. You should give it a read, it's a good website for those of you to begin.
2. [What is Virtual Memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlH4-oHnBb8&ab_channel=DavidBlack-Schaffer)<br>
What exactly is a virtual memory? In this video you are going to learn more about what a virtual memory is. Basically if i have to describe it, a virtual memory is a concept of a non-physical memory. How cool is that? What is it for though? For example, let's say a program is directing us into a specific address, and later on we wrote a different code which leads into the same address. We use virtual memory to prevent memory overwriting.
3. [Paging File? What's that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2RogbAbqY4&ab_channel=OldGuyGeek)<br> 
Now now, we've already learnt about memory from the links above. Next i'm going to intoduce you guys to paging file. What exactly is paging file? It is actually an act of moving a data mapping from your actual memory into your virtual one. Interesting isn't it? You can always check the link above if you are interested :/
